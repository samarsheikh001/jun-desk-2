# 04 — Open source, one-click deploy on Cloudflare

*As of 2026-10-03. Follows decisions D-02 and D-03.*

## Deploy to Cloudflare button

Source: [Cloudflare docs — Deploy buttons](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/deploy-buttons/)

- **Auto-provisioned bindings:** KV, D1, R2, Hyperdrive, Vectorize, Secrets Store, Durable Objects, Workers AI, Queues. Everything our stack needs can be created by the button.
- **Secrets:** declared in `.dev.vars.example` / `.env.example`; the deployer is prompted for values at deploy time. Plain config goes in wrangler `vars`. Bindings can have descriptions in `package.json` (inline markdown) to guide the user.
- **Limitations:**
  - Workers only, not Pages. The dashboard must be served by the Worker (static assets), not a Pages project.
  - Public GitHub/GitLab repos only.
  - Monorepo: if the button URL points at a subdirectory, that app must be fully self-contained there, including dependencies. **This constrains repo layout.**
  - D1 migrations must reference the **binding name**, not the database name.

## Implications

- **No external Postgres.** Hyperdrive is provisionable, but it needs a Postgres the user hosts elsewhere, which breaks "one click". Default to **D1 + Durable Object SQLite**; Postgres via Hyperdrive could be an optional "scale" mode later.
- **LLM without keys:** Workers AI is provisioned automatically, so a fresh deploy can answer with zero API keys. Claude (BYO Anthropic key, prompted as a secret) should be the recommended quality option. → D-10.
- **Vectorize** replaces pgvector for the knowledge base.
- **R2** for attachments and (later) replay snippets.
- **Email:** Cloudflare Email Service for magic links and notifications (to verify at build time).

## D1 limits

Source: [D1 limits](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/platform/limits/)

| Limit | Free | Workers Paid |
|---|---|---|
| Max DB size | 500 MB | 10 GB |
| DBs per account | 10 | 50,000 |
| Storage per account | 5 GB | 1 TB |
| Queries per Worker invocation | 50 | 1,000 |

- Max 100 bound parameters per query, 100 columns per table, 2 MB rows, 30 s query timeout.
- **Each D1 database is single-threaded** — queries run one at a time. Hot paths (presence, typing, message fan-out) must stay in Durable Objects; D1 holds durable records and reporting.
- For a self-hosted install (one company), 10 GB is plenty for conversations and metadata. Page-view firehose must be aggregated, not stored raw.

## Open source references on Cloudflare

- Cloudflare Agents SDK `AIChatAgent` — per-conversation agent on a DO, SQLite up to 10 GB per agent, scheduler, MCP client/server ([docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/concepts/agent-class/)).
- To research next: whether Durable Objects (SQLite-backed) are usable on the Workers **Free** plan, i.e. can someone self-host at $0? *(unverified)*
