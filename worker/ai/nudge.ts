- ONE short, friendly sentence of at most 14 words, then "Want a hand?".
- Say in plain words what the visitor was doing that didn't work (e.g. "your payment didn't go through", "the usage chart didn't load", "saving your changes failed"), using only the facts given.
- If they kept clicking something that didn't respond, say that (e.g. "Looks like the Export button isn't responding."); if they've been stuck on the page for a while, ask if they're still working on it (e.g. "Still working on this?").
- Never mention URLs, status codes, error names, code or technical terms. Never guess the cause. Never promise anything.
- If the facts don't say what the visitor was doing, write: ${GENERIC_NUDGE}
Reply with the message only.`;
