This folder is your Jun Desk AI agent, as code. Edit it like any other code: in a branch, reviewed in a pull request.

| File | What it does |
|---|---|
| \`AGENTS.md\` | Persona, tone and rules. Frontmatter sets guardrails (\`maxReplies\`, \`handoffTopics\`). |
| \`skills/<name>/SKILL.md\` | Procedures in plain language ("refund requests: first…"). \`description\` says when one applies. With \`intent:\`, your app can open a chat straight into it (see below). |
| \`tools/<name>.yaml\` | HTTP lookups the AI may call (order status, plan, usage…). |
| \`evals/<name>.yaml\` | Test cases: a customer message and what a good reply does. |

\`\`\`sh
jun eval .        # run the test cases and replay recent real conversations against these files
jun push . -m "…" # make it live (the dashboard shows each version)
jun pull .        # bring dashboard edits back here
\`\`\`

To add a tool, copy \`tools/lookup_order.yaml.example\` to \`tools/lookup_order.yaml\`, point it at your API,
and set its secret on the Worker: \`npx wrangler secret put JUN_SECRET_ACME_API_KEY\`.

## Intents: open a chat for a purpose

\`skills/cancellation/SKILL.md\` is an example. Your app's "Cancel subscription" button calls

\`\`\`js
JunDesk.open({ intent: "cancel", onExit: () => { location.href = "/billing/cancel"; } });
\`\`\`

The chat starts with the skill's \`opening\` and \`replies\` (no AI needed), the AI follows the skill, and
the \`exit\` button ("Cancel anyway") stays on screen: one click closes the chat and calls \`onExit\`.
Offers come only from your skill and tools: copy \`tools/apply_save_offer.yaml.example\` to
\`tools/apply_save_offer.yaml\` to let the AI apply one after the customer says yes.

1. Ask for the order or invoice number if they haven't given it.

# Intent (AI-20): your app opens this chat with JunDesk.open({ intent: "cancel", onExit }).
intent: cancel
opening: "Sorry to see you go. What's the main reason?"
replies: [Too expensive, Not using it enough, Missing a feature, Something isn't working, Switching to another tool, Other]
exit: Cancel anyway       # always on screen, one click: closes the chat and calls your onExit
---
1. If they haven't said why, ask for the main reason, once.
2. Try to fix the real problem first:
   - Something isn't working: explain what failed (the technical context helps) and flag it to the team.
   - Missing a feature: check the sources for it or a workaround.
   - Not using it enough: offer one short tip for what they signed up to do.
3. At most one offer, and only the one that fits their reason (edit these to what you really offer):
   - Too expensive: 50% off the next 3 months (offer: discount_50_3m).
   - Not using it enough: pause the subscription for up to 3 months (offer: pause_3m).
   - Missing a feature, switching to another tool, or other: no offer. Ask what would have made them stay.
4. Before applying an offer with apply_save_offer, say exactly what changes and wait for a clear yes.
   If that tool isn't set up, hand off to a person with the accepted offer in the reason.
5. If they say no or still want to cancel, thank them and point them to the "Cancel anyway" button
   (or, if there isn't one in this chat, to Settings → Billing). Never argue or push again.
